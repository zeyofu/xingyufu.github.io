- I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer and Information Science Department at University of Pennsylvania, advised by Prof. [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/).
- My research interests lie in multimodality, specifically vision and language understanding. 
- I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I was very fortunate to have worked with Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/).
